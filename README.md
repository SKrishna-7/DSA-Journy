# 🚀 DSA Journey — Python & C++ (Striver’s A2Z Sheet)

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository** 👨‍💻  
This repo documents my complete DSA learning path — implemented in both **Python** 🐍 and **C++** ⚡ —  
based on **[Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

I’m preparing for **tech rounds at product-based companies** (like Zoho, Amazon, and others),  
focusing on **problem-solving, logic development, and code optimization**.

This repository tracks my **daily DSA progress**, **concept breakdowns**, and **hands-on implementations** —  
from **Basics → Patterns → Recursion → Advanced DSA**.

## 🧠 Concepts I’m Mastering

### 📘 Core Problem-Solving
- Breaking problems into sub-parts
- Understanding **time and space complexity**
- Dry-running & visualizing loop patterns

### 🧮 Mathematics
- Divisors, Prime Checks, and Armstrong logic
- Logarithmic digit counting and GCD/LCM
- Efficient number manipulation using math functions

### 🧱 Patterns & Loops
- Mastering **nested loop relationships**
- Pyramid, Diamond, Hollow, and Butterfly patterns
- Logic-based visualization of symmetry

### 💡 Coding in Two Languages
I’m writing every concept in both **C++** and **Python** to:
- Strengthen logic language-independently
- Prepare for both **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**
