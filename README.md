# 🚀 DSA Journey — Python & C++ 

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository** 👨‍💻  
This repo documents my complete DSA learning path — implemented in both **Python** 🐍 and **C++** ⚡ —  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objective

I’m preparing for **tech rounds at product-based companies**,  
focusing on **problem-solving, logic development, and code optimization**.

This repository tracks my **daily DSA progress**, **concept breakdowns**, and **hands-on implementations** —  
from **Basics → Patterns → Recursion → Advanced DSA**.

## 🧭 Learning Path Overview

| Phase | Topic | Description | Status |
|--------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1️ | **Pattern Problems** | Build logic using nested loops, symmetry, and visualization | ✅ Completed |
| 2️ | **Basic Maths** | Learn mathematical foundations used in algorithms | ✅ Completed |
| 3 | **Basics of Recursion & Backtracking** | Learn problem breakdown and decision tree logic |🔄 In Progress |
| 4 | **Sorting & Searching** | Implement efficient algorithms and understand complexity | ✅ Completed |
| 5 | **Arrays & Hashing** | Work with data storage, traversal, and frequency problems | 🔄 In Progress |
| 6 | **Linked Lists & Stacks** | Deep dive into pointers, memory, and dynamic data structures | 🔜  |
| 7 | **Trees, Graphs & DP** | Master structured & optimized problem-solving | 🔜 Planned |

### 💡 Coding in Two Languages
I’m writing every concept in both **C++** and **Python** to:
- Strengthen logic language-independently
- Prepare for both **competitive programming** and **technical interviews**

## 🧮 Using Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet

This entire journey is guided by  
👉 **[Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet (TakeUForward)](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)**

### 🔗 Sheet Highlights:
- Complete DSA roadmap — from basic to advanced
- Covers **patterns, maths, arrays, recursion, graphs, DP**, etc.
- Designed for **placement preparation & interview success**

---

## 🚀 Goals Ahead

- ✅ Strengthen logic fundamentals  
- 🔄 Solve 3–5 problems daily  
- 💬 Document every concept clearly  
- 🧠 Build intuition for optimizing brute force  
- 🏢 Crack **product-based company interviews**
